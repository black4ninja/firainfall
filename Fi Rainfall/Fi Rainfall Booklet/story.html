<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="parrafo">
<p>In the beginning of time there was only darkness where lived two goddess  Sera and Lana. They spent their time listening to the universe around but none  of them dared to go beyond what they heard. </p>
<p><span title="">One day a  flame appeared in the center of the universe putting all existence in grave  danger. </span><span title="">The goddess came to the conclusion that to save the  universe one of them should be sacrificed. </span></p>
<p><span title="">Lana feared death so Sera with all  her value boldly launched into the flame to extinguish the fire. </span><span title="">Its sacrifice created the elemental deities. </span><span title="">Lana, jealous of the sacrifice and value of Sera launched into the flames and unexpectedly the flame consumed itself saving  both goddess.</span><br />
  </p>
<p><span title="">Both Sera and Lana came to life, but with  new power joined as the sun and moon. Also Sera became one of the elemental  deities while Lana became the deity of the night. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span title="">After all  destruction elemental deities created the universe and a place to live. The  world of Ezaye. </span></p>
<p><span title="">Sera invited Lana to live in the new world, but she preferred stay away in roder to see the world from the universe. </span></p>
<p><span title="">After creation, Sera went  to sleep on top of the heaven to be with Lana making in Ezaye the legends of  Sun and Moon, hoping that someday if Sera was needed she could appear again. </span></p>
<p><span title="">The three deities were left in the ground awaiting the return of Sera  and soon began to feel lonely. </span><span title="">Water deity Lily  and the  deity of fire Kin slept alone every day. </span><span title="">For its part,  Xerra the deity of the land decided to create beings to have someone to play.  Unfortunately they lacked of thinking. </span><span title="">Before its  retreat, Sera gave remains of the flame to Xerra for gave the power to make one  creature able to think. With this power she used it to make humans existences  appear.</span><br />
  <br />
  <span title="">Xerra began to see the development  of reason but soon became overwhelmed by human thought. </span><span title="">Sad  joined her sisters who just slept and tried to comfort her. </span></p>
<p><span title="">Soon, humans began to destroy the earth elemental deities created. </span><span title="">Sad for not being capable of doing anything the deities retreated into a  deep sleep. </span></p>
<p><span title="">Xerra retreated to the highest mountains,  while Lily retired to the depths of the oceans and  Kin into the volcanoes  all awaiting the return of Sera. </span></p>
<p><span title="">Gradually, humans forgot  those who had created them.</span></p>
<p><span title=""> The remains of the flame started to corrupt the world again with the destruction made by humankind and  all the universe is becoming in danger again. </span></p>
<p><span title="">As a symbol of the time of her return Sera constructed a  sanctuary in which only the purest human could enter and only the sound of his true  heart will save Ezaye and vanish all the destruction.</span></p>

<h1>Story of the 3 Sisters</h1>
<div class="parrafo"><p>Lisa, Darcy and Rita are three young sisters who lived far from large  cities in Ezaye, both by his father who was a researcher well known, and her  mother that had an illness in his heart so she cannot live in places with many  people. <span title="">Despite going to buy food or items from time to  time to the city, the sisters preferred to live in the woods because they loved  where they lived. </span><span title="">Sometimes the sisters venture into the  forest in search of strange animals, or unknown places.</span><br />
  <br />
  <span title="">One day the three sisters went out  for a walk and gradually penetrate into the forest. Without realizing it that  they were venturing into the darkest side, where a presence took all the forest  creatures away. </span><span title="">Shortly after having ventured into the  darkest area, the sisters came to a place where the trees started to disappear  leaving in the sky a hole where it filtered the light of heaven. </span><span title=""> </span><br />
  In the middle of the light was a rock with ancient symbols written on it. Lisa  felt as if the rock was calling to her so she walked closer to the rock. <span title="">Darcy and Rita tried to stop her but only ended up going too</span><br />
  .<br />
  <span title="">Lisa's started to check the rock and  soon she remembered some of the symbols because of her dad but some other of  whom she had never seen were running all into her head. </span><span title="">Determined  Lisa approached the center of the rock touching it. Scared Darcy and Rita see  her from behind but unexpectedly the symbols began to reveal a flash enclosing  the sisters. </span><span title="">The flash affected the three sisters and they  fall into a deep sleep.</span><br />
  <br />
  <span title="">Everything was dark but Lisa could  her Darcy’s voice and Rita’s crying at her side. </span><span title="">With  fear and not knowing what could happen next Lisa tried to move but something  does not allow it. </span><span title="">A voice began to call the three  sisters.</span></p>
 <div class="cursiva">
 <p>"The universe is in grave danger again ... you need to save Ezaye ...you should go to the mountains ... the ocean ... and beyond the center of the world ...the sky..."</p>
 </div>
 <p>A great flame lit up the place, it do not look anything like the forest  where they were a moment ago. <span title="">Under them it was a flame  and in all her expression they thank it was the universe. However the flame  started to move and destroy everythingit was all a massacre. A </span><span title="">greater light suddenly flooded the place and gradually the sisters  were waking from their strange dream. </span><span title=""> </span><br />
   Lisa immediately step up while Darcy helped Rita get into her feet. The  three sisters were surprised to see his father a few steps from the rock and he  looked radiant in happiness. <span title="">Her father explained to the  sisters that despite being born as normal girls they were not normal humans. </span><span title=""> </span><br />
   The story of the father to the sisters went back a few days before they  were born. <span title="">The goddess of the sun and wind Sera had  visited him and his wife saying that a serious danger to the universe was  approaching. Soon only the pure heart of three girls could wake her to prevent  this catastrophe. Those hearts came from the union of her father and his mother. </span><span title="">That was the reason why their mother lost the power of her  heart in that illness because her most important qualities were transmitted to  each one of the sisters. </span><span title="">After telling the story their  father told them that Sera had promised to give the girls power to fulfill their  mission. </span><span title="">But it would be a difficult road. </span><span title="">Darcy and Rita were afraid and began to mourn and cry in their  father's arms, but Lisa catch them up and told them they had been selected by  Sera to wake her up and its destiny was to fulfill it. </span><span title=""> </span><br />
   Sad to let go of their daughters her father encouraged them because he  understood their destiny. From his pocket her father took an old book which  gave to Darcy. <span title="">He told them that throughout his research  he had come to the place they were before and found secrets that would help the  sisters with their mission and more importantly how to call the power within its  insides. </span><span title="">Delivering a bag of colored feathers to each one,  the father said he suspected that these feathers were from Sera, and each would  give them the magic and the power necessary to reach and survive the dangers.</span><br />
  <br />
  <span title="">Without hesitation Lisa turned to  her sisters with a big smile and all returned home. Her mother knew about the  situation a few hours later they came back. Proud of her daughters she hugged  them with the hope that they could wake Sera. Several days passed after that  incident and the three sisters spent a few days while they were preparing for  their new adventure and knowing about their new </span><span title="">powers. </span><span title=""> </span><br />
   After a workout based on research of the symbols of his father, Darcy was  able to invoke the power of flight using one of the feathers that had been  given to her. <span title="">Instructing her sister she just told them  to concentrate on using the power of a feather to use it. When all were finally  able to fly, her father said they were ready to undertake its mission and save  Ezaye...</span></p>
